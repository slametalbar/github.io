            "Arena" is a science fiction short story by American writer Fredric Brown, first published in the June 1944 issue of Astounding Science Fiction magazine. The members of the Science Fiction Writers of America selected it as one of the best science fiction stories published before the advent of the Nebula Awards, and as such it was included in The Science Fiction Hall of Fame, Volume One, 1929–1964.<br/><br/>Its most famous adaptation is in the American television series, Star Trek, with an episode of the same name.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== Plot summary ==<br/><br/>Amid escalating conflict between Earth and mysterious alien Outsiders, massive armadas from both sides are set to meet in what looks to be an evenly matched battle. Bob Carson, the pilot of a small one-man scout ship, blacks out while engaging with an Outsider counterpart. When he awakens, he finds himself naked in a small, enclosed, circular area about 250 yards (230 m) across. Most of the objects in the arena are blue, and the arena is, according to Carson, "unbearably hot", with no available water. In the distance is an Outsider, which Carson labels a "Roller" because its form is that of a red sphere about 1 yard (0.91 m) in diameter with about a dozen thin, retractable tentacles.<br/><br/>Carson hears a voice in his mind that identifies itself as an ancient intelligence, the fusion of an entire race, which has intervened because the war would utterly destroy one side and hurt the other so badly that it would not be able to possibly one day evolve into an intelligence like itself. The Entity  therefore has chosen one individual from each species to fight in single combat in an arena outside of the normal flow of time.
